## Privacy, Security and other info

* App only acts as intermediate to MyAnimeList and AniList and does not have it's own server or
  store any data.
* App only has network permissions, the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`,
  `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` & `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` in the merged manifest is
  from [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) which is not included in the release
  builds.
* App stores the token
  using [Datastore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore), which
  is not encrypted. This implies anyone with debugging access or root access
  to your phone can get the your OAuth token if needed. Please keep this in mind.
* The app doesn't fetch "live data" and only shows the snapshot of data of when it was fetched.
  Please refresh to see any changes made through the MyAnimeList website or other clients.
* The app queries all browsers in the device to handle unsupported MyAnimeList deeplinks. This is
  done as the API does not still support all the features provided in the web interface.
